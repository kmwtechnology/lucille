# Release Versioning

Lucille releases do not adhere to set calendar cadence. However, they occur roughly once a month and use the following versioning scheme:

 | Release Type   | Example        | Happens When...                                                                      |
 |----------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Major Release  | 1.3.0 -> 2.0.0 | Major Breaking Changes are being introduced during a release                         |
 | Minor Release  | 1.3.0 -> 1.4.0 | Once we have accumulated enough features to merit a release (roughly once per month) |
 | Hotfix Release | 1.3.0 -> 1.3.1 | A release is required to patch bug fixes, CVEs or other extenuating circumstance     |
