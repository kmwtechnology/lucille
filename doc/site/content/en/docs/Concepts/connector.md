## Lucille Connectors

Connectors are components that retrieve data from a source system, packages the data into "documents," and publishes them to a pipeline.

The core Lucille project contains a number of commonly used connectors. Additional connectors that rely on a large number of dependencies are provided as optional plugin modules.
