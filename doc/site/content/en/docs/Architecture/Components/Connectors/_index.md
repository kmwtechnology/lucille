## Lucille Connectors

Lucille Connectors are components that retrieve data from a source system, packages the data into "Documents", and publishes them to a pipeline.

To configure a Connector, you have to provide its class (under `class`) in its config. You also need to specify a `name` for the Connector.
Optionally, you can specify the `pipeline`, a `docIdPrefix`, and whether the Connector requires a Publisher to `collapse`.

You'll also provide the parameters needed by the Connector as well. For example, the `SequenceConnector` requires one parameter, `numDocs`,
and accepts an optional parameter, `startWith`. So, a `SequenceConnector` Config would look something like this:

```hocon
{
  name: "Sequence-Connector-1"
  class: "com.kmwllc.lucille.connector.SequenceConnector"
  docIdPrefix: "sequence-connector-1-"
  pipeline: "pipeline1"
  numDocs: 500
  startWith: 50
}
```

The `lucille-core` module contains a number of commonly used connectors. Additional connectors with a large number of dependencies are provided as optional plugin modules.
