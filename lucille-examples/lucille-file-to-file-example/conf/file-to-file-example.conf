# this ingest runs two connectors in sequence
#   the first connector reads from a csv file (source.csv)
#   the second connector reads from a newline-delimited json file (source.jsonl)
#
# both connectors feed to the same simple pipeline that renames various fields by adding a "my_" prefix
#
# a CSV indexer appends all processed documents to a dest.csv file
#
# overall, what's happening is that data from one CSV file and one JSON file is being lightly transformed and
# consolidated into a single CSV
#
# this example illustrates how Lucille can operate in a file-to-file mode without actually interacting with a search backend
# this example illustrates how Lucille config files can be subdivided into smaller reusable sections that can be
# included from the main config


# this illustrates how we can include connector definitions from other files and bind them to variables
