/**
 * <p> Holds / manages a connection to a JDBC database used to maintain state regarding FileConnector traversals and the last
 * time files were processed and published by Lucille.
 * <p> Build a connection to a JDBC-compatible database (can be embedded or not)
 *
 * <p> Call {@link #init()} and {@link #shutdown()} to connect / disconnect to the database.
 *
 * <p> The database should/will have the following Columns:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>name (VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY): The full path (for cloud, the full URI) to the file. Defaults to a length of 200.
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>Names are case-sensitive - it is very important to keep the pathToStorage consistent in your Config when using state.</li>
 *       </ul>
 *     </li>
 *     <li>last_published (TIMESTAMP): The last time the file was known to be published by Lucille. Is NULL for directories.</li>
 *     <li>encountered (BOOLEAN): Used internally to track files which have been encountered in a traversal, enabling deletions.</li>
 *   </ul>
 *
 * <p> Lucille includes H2 as a dependency. You are welcome to configure the FileConnectorStateManager to use an embedded
 * H2 instance - use the <code>org.h2.Driver</code>, and something like <code>jdbc:h2:{LOCAL_FILE_PATH}</code> as your connectionString.
 *
 * <p> <b>Note:</b> This class is operating under two key assumptions about FileConnector / Connectors:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Connectors run sequentially.</li>
 *   <li>The FileConnector is not multithreaded.</li>
 * </ol>
