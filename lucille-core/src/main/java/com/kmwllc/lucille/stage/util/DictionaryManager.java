/**
 * Provides a way for Stage instances to acquire dictionaries.
 *
 * Dictionaries are read-only and are loaded from the CSV content at a designated filesystem path.
 *
 * Dictionary instances are safe to share across threads (because they are unmodifiable HashMaps).
 *
 * DictionaryManager is intended as an optimization that eliminates the need for each Stage instance to initialize and store
 * its own dedicated dictionary instance. Using DictionaryManager, the dictionary for a given path is
 * initialized once, upon the first request to access it; the single instance of that dictionary is
 * returned upon subsequent requests.
 *
 * Stages that need to obtain a read-only dictionary from a CSV file can call
 * DictionaryManager.getDictionary("/path/to/dictionary.csv", ignoreCase, setOnly)
 *
 * When requesting a dictionary from the same CSV but with different settings of ignoreCase and setOnly,
 * a different dictionary instance will be created for each combination, because these settings
 * affect the contents of the dictionary.

  /**
   * Returns an unmodifiable Map built from the CSV file at the designated path.
   * The Map lets us lookup a keyword and retrieve an array containing either the keyword itself
   * (indicating that the keyword is found in the given dictionary) or a sequence of payloads associated with
   * the keyword.
   *
   * If a Map has already been populated for a given path (and given setting of ignoreCase and setOnly),
   * the first instance will be returned and a second instance will not be created. Note that the config does not
   * affect the key / path used - it can only affect whether the file (particularly, if it is held on cloud storage)
   * CAN be retrieved successfully in the first place!
   *
   * Each Stage instance that needs to acquire a dictionary should call this method once inside start().
   * Because Stage instances will not be calling this method more than once at startup time, we use a coarse-grained
   * approach of making the entire method synchronized. This is to ensure that at most one instance of each
   * named dictionary can be created. We are not concerned about the overhead of contention because
   * this method is not called repeatedly in the Stage lifecycle; it is only called once at startup.
   *
   * This implementation explicitly DOES NOT permit the concurrent loading of different dictionaries by different threads.
   * Using this implementation, only one thread can enter getDictionary() at a time, meaning that only one dictionary
   * can be initialized at a time.
   *
   * Note that the "dictionaries" HashMap is only ever accessed or updated inside this one method. Since this method
   * is synchronized, the dictionaries HashMap itself does not need to be thread-safe (by being
   * made into a ConcurrentHashMap or being passed through Collections.synchronizedMap()).
