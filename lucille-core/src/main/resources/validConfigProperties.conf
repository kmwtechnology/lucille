# Each of these are an optional parent. Required properties are only "required" if the parent is present
# in a Lucille Config. This allows us to validate all properties of a Lucille Config that aren't pipelines, connectors,
# or indexers / specific indexers.

# You'll note that this file / framework only supports optional / required properties, and not parents. Since validating parents
# is a more involved / thorough process, if a portion of Lucille configs needs to validate children (that isn't
# connector/pipeline/indexer), it should be done in the constructor.
