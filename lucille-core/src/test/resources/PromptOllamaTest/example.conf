I will be providing you JSON objects representing an email from the publicly available Enron dataset. Based on the information
in the email, your task is to output a JSON object like this:

{
  "fraud": false
  "summary": "Mark is asking Beverly about her flight plans for the upcoming business conference."
}

The first field, fraud, represents whether the email is evidence of fraud / wrongdoing at Enron. False positives are more desirable than false negatives here.
The second field, summary, is a single sentence summary of the emails contents, no longer than twenty-five words.
